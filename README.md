# 🚑 Ambulance Detection & Smart Alert System 🚦

---

## 📝 Description

A powerful, AI-driven solution for **real-time ambulance detection** at traffic signals.  
This system uses YOLO & CNN models to identify ambulances from live video feeds and images, automates emergency lane clearance, and sends smart alerts to traffic police and signals within a 5-7 km radius.  
Designed to work **offline and online** for uninterrupted emergency support!

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🤖 **AI Ambulance Detection:** YOLO + CNN models for fast, reliable identification.
- 🎥 **Live Video/Image Capture:** Works with traffic cameras and snapshots.
- 🛑 **Automated Signal Switching:** Unlocks the emergency lane instantly.
- 🚨 **Smart Alerts:** Notifies traffic signals & police stations nearby.
- 💾 **PHP & MySQL Backend:** Logs all detections and system events.
- 📊 **Dashboard:** Real-time monitoring and alert management.
- 🌐 **Works With & Without Internet:** Never stops—syncs data when online!
