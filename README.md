## Overview

**Ambulance Detection and Smart Alert System** leverages artificial intelligence to solve a critical urban challenge: ambulances stuck in traffic.  
By using advanced computer vision models (YOLO & CNN) and integrating with real-time traffic infrastructure, this project ensures ambulances reach those in need as quickly as possible.

---

## 🚨 Why Is This Needed?

Every minute counts in an emergency.

> **Did you know?**  
> In busy cities, ambulances often get locked in traffic at intersections — risking lives due to delayed medical attention.

This project automatically identifies ambulances in traffic camera feeds, instantly alerts police and traffic signals within a 5–7 km radius, and switches signals to clear lanes for emergency passage.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-Time Ambulance Detection:**  
  Uses YOLO and CNN to spot ambulances in live video and traffic signal images.
- **Automatic Alert System:**  
  Notifies traffic signals and police stations nearby for immediate action.
- **Emergency Lane Clearance:**  
  Triggers automatic signal switching to open lanes for ambulances.
- **Detection Logging:**  
  Stores detection events in MySQL for analysis and reporting.
- **User Dashboard:**  
  Web interface (PHP/HTML/JS) for monitoring and reviewing alerts, images, and videos.

## 🚦 System Flow

1. **Image/Video Capture:**  
   Traffic cameras stream footage to the detection module.
2. **Ambulance Detection:**  
   YOLO & CNN models scan frames for ambulances.
3. **Alert Triggering:**  
   Detections trigger alerts to nearby traffic signals & police.
4. **Lane Clearance:**  
   Signals are automatically switched to clear a path.
5. **Dashboard & Logging:**  
   Events and images/videos are logged and displayed for admins.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaikhNomaan-png/Ambulance-Detection-and-Smart-Alert-System.git
   ```
2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure PHP & MySQL backend**
   - Set up MySQL DB (`db.sql` in repo).
   - Configure `/backend/config.php`.

4. **Run detection module**
   ```bash
   python detect_ambulance.py
   ```
5. **Access dashboard**
   Open `/dashboard/index.php` in your browser.

## 💡 Impact

- **Faster Emergency Response:**  
  Ambulances spend less time waiting at intersections.
- **Smarter Cities:**  
  Combines AI and IoT for safer urban infrastructure.
- **Scalable & Open:**  
  Easy to deploy at new signals or cities.
