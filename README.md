# 🚑 Ambulance Detection & Smart Alert System 🚦

---

## 📝 Description

A powerful, AI-driven solution for **real-time ambulance detection** at traffic signals.  
This system uses YOLO & CNN models to identify ambulances from live video feeds and images, automates emergency lane clearance, and sends smart alerts to traffic police and signals within a 5-7 km radius.  
Designed to work **offline and online** for uninterrupted emergency support!
