# 🚑 Ambulance Detection and Smart Alert System

> **Harnessing Technology to Unlock Ambulance Traffic — Online & Offline**

---

## 📝 Overview

A cutting-edge project for real-time **ambulance detection at traffic signals** using AI (YOLO/CNN), with smart alerting and automated signal switching—even in offline scenarios. The system integrates with PHP/MySQL for logging and dashboard management, and operates both **with and without internet connectivity** to ensure continuous emergency support.

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Without Internet (Offline Mode):**
   - AI models run locally on edge devices.
   - Ambulance detection and signal switching work autonomously.
   - Data is stored locally and synced when internet is restored.

2. **With Internet (Online Mode):**
   - Real-time alerts are sent to police and traffic management within 5-7 km.
   - Dashboard updates, remote monitoring, and cloud logging.
   - Emergency lane clearance automated from anywhere.
