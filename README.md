# üöë Ambulance Detection and Smart Alert System

> **Empowering Emergency Response with AI & IoT**

---

## Overview

This project is a **real-time ambulance detection system** that leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models to **identify ambulances from live video feeds and images** at traffic signals. The system is integrated with PHP and MySQL for logging, alerting, and dashboard management. Its primary goal: **unlock the traffic for ambulances, save lives, and make cities smarter.**

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Detection:**  
  Detect ambulances in traffic using state-of-the-art YOLO & CNN models.

- **Live Video & Image Capture:**  
  Process video feeds and snapshots from traffic cameras.

- **Smart Alerts:**  
  Automatically notify traffic signals and police stations **within a 5-7 km radius**.

- **Emergency Lane Clearance:**  
  Auto-switch traffic signals to clear lanes for ambulances.

- **Real-time Dashboard:**  
  View detection logs, alerts, and current traffic status.

- **Easy Integration:**  
  Built with PHP & MySQL backend for seamless database and alert operations.

## üö¶ How It Works

1. **Capture:**  
   Video feeds/images from traffic signals are analyzed in real time.

2. **Detect:**  
   YOLO/CNN models spot ambulances instantly.

3. **Log & Alert:**  
   Detections are logged; alerts sent to nearby signals and police.

4. **Signal Switch:**  
   Traffic lights automatically change to free up the emergency lane.
