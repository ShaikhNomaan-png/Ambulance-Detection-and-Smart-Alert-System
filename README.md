## Overview

**Ambulance Detection and Smart Alert System** is an advanced real-time solution designed to improve emergency response in urban environments. By harnessing cutting-edge computer vision and web technologies, this project identifies ambulances from live video feeds at traffic signals and automates emergency lane clearance through smart alerts.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilizes YOLO and CNN models to accurately spot ambulances from live video streams and traffic camera images.
- **Automated Alerts**: Instantly notifies traffic signals and police stations within a 5–7 km radius for rapid action.
- **Dashboard Interface**: Web-based dashboard for monitoring detections, reviewing images/videos, and managing alerts.
- **Emergency Lane Clearance**: Automatically switches traffic signals to clear lanes for ambulances.
- **Detection Logging**: Stores all detection events securely in MySQL for future analytics and audits.

![System Architecture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Traffic_signal_cycle_diagram.png)

1. **Image/Video Capture**  
   Cameras at traffic signals stream footage to the detection module.
2. **Ambulance Detection**  
   YOLO & CNN models analyze frames for ambulances.
3. **Alert Triggering**  
   On detection, alerts sent to traffic signals & police stations.
4. **Automated Signal Switching**  
   Emergency lanes are cleared by adjusting traffic signals.
5. **Dashboard & Logging**  
   Admins view events, images, and logs via a dashboard.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaikhNomaan-png/Ambulance-Detection-and-Smart-Alert-System.git
   ```
2. **Set up Python environment**  
   Install requirements for YOLO/CNN modules.
   ```bash
